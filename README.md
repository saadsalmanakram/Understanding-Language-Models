# Understanding-Language-Models
Understanding Language Models in detail. The different architectures and all core concepts.

Hello Github community, just wanted to mention a few things. The idea of this repository is to understand the key concepts and eveything related to Large Language Models.
Also the idea is not to clean sole ownership of every content in this repo. You are free to use it and learn from it. I myself have learned and gather a lot of knowledge from other resources like Hugging Face etc. And a huge shoutout to hugging face for providing valueable resource, so if any content or information resembles with Huggingface or any other entity remember its their original content and they rightfully own it. So just keep an open mind and just learn...
