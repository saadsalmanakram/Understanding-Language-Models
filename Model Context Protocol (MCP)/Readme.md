# Model Context Protocol (MCP) - A Comprehensive Guide

![MCP Logo](hhttps://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F3aabd8804251c0364cbde9d2e4be6dc8e8c2faec-2880x1620.png&w=3840&q=75)

## 🚀 Get Started (Official Site: [](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction))
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a **USB-C port** for AI applications—just as USB-C provides a universal way to connect devices, MCP enables AI models to connect with diverse data sources and tools in a standardized way.

### 🌟 What's New?
✅ **C# SDK Released** - Now you can integrate MCP into your C# applications effortlessly!
✅ **Expanded Integration Support** - More pre-built connectors for databases, APIs, and tools.
✅ **Enhanced Security** - Improved best practices for securing data within your infrastructure.

## 📌 Why MCP?
Building AI agents and complex workflows requires seamless integration with data and tools. MCP provides:

- **Pre-built Integrations**: Easily plug LLMs into databases, APIs, and tools.
- **LLM Flexibility**: Switch between AI models from different providers.
- **Secure Infrastructure**: Follow best practices for keeping your data safe.

## 🏗 General Architecture
At its core, MCP follows a **client-server architecture** where host applications communicate with multiple servers:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│       Host with MCP Client  │  (Claude, IDEs, AI Tools)
└───────────┬────────────────┘
            │
            ▼
   ┌────────────────────┐
   │   MCP Server A     │ → Local Data Source A
   └────────────────────┘
   ┌────────────────────┐
   │   MCP Server B     │ → Local Data Source B
   └────────────────────┘
   ┌────────────────────┐
   │   MCP Server C     │ → Remote Service C
   └────────────────────┘
```
### Components:
- **MCP Hosts**: AI applications (e.g., Claude Desktop, IDEs) using MCP.
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients maintaining connections with servers.
- **MCP Servers**: Programs exposing capabilities via MCP.
- **Local Data Sources**: Files, databases, and services on your machine.
- **Remote Services**: External APIs and cloud services.
