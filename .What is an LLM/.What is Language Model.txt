A language model is a type of model used in artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict or generate sequences of elements, typically within a specific language or symbol system. While commonly associated with text, language models can also be applied to other structured sequences like code, music, or even actions in a defined context. The model learns the probabilities of sequences based on training data, allowing it to understand, generate, or predict the next element in a sequence.
