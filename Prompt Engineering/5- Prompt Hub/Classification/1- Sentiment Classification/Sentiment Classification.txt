This task checks how well a Large Language Model (LLM) can recognize the tone or sentiment in a piece of text. The LLM needs to label the text as having a neutral, negative, or positive sentiment.

Prompt
You give the LLM a sentence, and it will classify whether the tone of the text is neutral, negative, or positive. For example:

- Text: "I think the food was okay."  
- Sentiment: Neutral

Prompt Template 
You can use this template to classify any text:

- Text: {your input}  
- Sentiment: {output from the LLM}

Code / API Usage

You can use the OpenAI API to get the LLM to classify text sentiment. Hereâ€™s a simple Python code example:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive\nText: I think the food was okay.\nSentiment:\n"
        }
    ],
    temperature=1,
    max_tokens=256,
    top_p=1,
    frequency_penalty=0,
    presence_penalty=0
)
```

This code sends the text "I think the food was okay." to the GPT-4 model and asks it to classify the sentiment. The model will return either neutral, negative, or positive as the sentiment label.
