This exercise tests an AI model's ability to write MySQL queries by giving it details about the database structure.

Scenario: 
You have two tables:

1. departments:  
   - Columns: `DepartmentId`, `DepartmentName`
   
2. students:  
   - Columns: `DepartmentId`, `StudentId`, `StudentName`

Task:  
Write a MySQL query to get all students who are in the "Computer Science" department.

Code Example:

Model: GPT-4

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Create a client instance for the OpenAI API
client = OpenAI()

# Use the client to send a request for generating a MySQL query
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": """
            Table departments, columns = [DepartmentId, DepartmentName]
            Table students, columns = [DepartmentId, StudentId, StudentName]
            Create a MySQL query for all students in the Computer Science department.
            """
        }
    ],
    temperature=1,
    max_tokens=1000
)
```

Model= Mixtral MoE 8x7B Instruct(Fireworks)

```python

import fireworks.client
fireworks.client.api_key = "<FIREWORKS_API_KEY>"
completion = fireworks.client.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
    messages=[
        {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "\"\"\"\nTable departments, columns = [DepartmentId, DepartmentName]\nTable students, columns = [DepartmentId, StudentId, StudentName]\nCreate a MySQL query for all students in the Computer Science Department\n\"\"\"",
        }
    ],
    stop=["<|im_start|>","<|im_end|>","<|endoftext|>"],
    stream=True,
    n=1,
    top_p=1,
    top_k=40,
    presence_penalty=0,
    frequency_penalty=0,
    prompt_truncate_len=1024,
    context_length_exceeded_behavior="truncate",
    temperature=0.9,
    max_tokens=4000
)


In this version, we break down the steps and information clearly, making it easier to understand the purpose and process of generating the query.
