This exercise tests how well an LLM can create code. We provide a description of what we want the code to do (in this case, through a comment), and the LLM will generate the appropriate code based on that.

Example:

Instruction (in a comment):
```python
/*
Ask the user for their name and greet them by saying "Hello".
*/
```

Generated Code using OpenAI API:
```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()

# Send the instruction as a message to the LLM (e.g., GPT-4)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "/*\nAsk the user for their name and say \"Hello\"\n*/"
        }
    ],
    temperature=1,  # Adjusts the creativity of the response
    max_tokens=1000,  # Limits the length of the generated code
    top_p=1,  # Controls the diversity of the output
    frequency_penalty=0,  # Reduces repetition in the output
    presence_penalty=0  # Controls how much the model talks about new topics
)
```

```python

import fireworks.client
fireworks.client.api_key = "<FIREWORKS_API_KEY>"
completion = fireworks.client.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
    messages=[
        {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "/*\nAsk the user for their name and say \"Hello\"\n*/",
        }
    ],
    stop=["<|im_start|>","<|im_end|>","<|endoftext|>"],
    stream=True,
    n=1,
    top_p=1,
    top_k=40,
    presence_penalty=0,
    frequency_penalty=0,
    prompt_truncate_len=1024,
    context_length_exceeded_behavior="truncate",
    temperature=0.9,
    max_tokens=4000
)
```

What happens:
The LLM will look at the comment and produce a code snippet that asks for the userâ€™s name and greets them with "Hello".
