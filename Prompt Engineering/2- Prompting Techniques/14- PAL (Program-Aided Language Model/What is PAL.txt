In their 2022 paper, Gao et al. introduced a method called Program-Aided Language Models (PAL). This method leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language questions and generate computer programs as part of the reasoning process. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on free-form text, PAL uses a programmatic runtime, such as a Python interpreter, to calculate the answers.

Example Application Using LangChain and OpenAI GPT-3

Let’s create a simple application using LangChain and OpenAI GPT-3. Our goal is to build a functionality that interprets questions involving dates and provides accurate answers through the Python interpreter.

Setting Up the Environment

First, we need to import some necessary libraries:

```python
import openai
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

Next, we configure our environment:

```python
load_dotenv()

# Set the API key for OpenAI
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# For LangChain, set the API key again
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

Setting Up the Model

Now, we will create an instance of the language model:

```python
llm = OpenAI(model_name='text-davinci-003', temperature=0)
```

Defining a Question and Prompt

Let’s define a question that requires understanding dates:

```python
question = "Today is March 15, 2023. I was born 18 years ago. What is my birth date in MM/DD/YYYY?"
```

Now, we’ll create a prompt that includes a few example questions to guide the LLM:

```python
DATE_UNDERSTANDING_PROMPT = """
# Q: What is the date one week from 03/01/2024?
# Today is 03/01/2024.
today = datetime(2024, 3, 1)
# One week from today is
one_week_from_today = today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
# The answer formatted is
one_week_from_today.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')

# Q: If today is 12/25/2020, what was the date two weeks ago?
# Today is 12/25/2020.
today = datetime(2020, 12, 25)
# Two weeks ago is
two_weeks_ago = today - relativedelta(weeks=2)
# The answer formatted is
two_weeks_ago.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')

# Q: Today is 04/10/2025. I was born on 04/10/2000. How old am I today?
# Today is 04/10/2025.
today = datetime(2025, 4, 10)
# I was born on 04/10/2000.
born = datetime(2000, 4, 10)
# My age is
age = today.year - born.year
# The answer formatted is
age

# Q: {question}
""".strip() + '\n'
```

Getting the Output

Now we can ask the language model to generate the code for our question:

```python
llm_out = llm(DATE_UNDERSTANDING_PROMPT.format(question=question))
print(llm_out)
```

The output will be a Python code snippet that looks something like this:

```python
# If today is March 15, 2023 and I was born 18 years ago, then I was born 18 years before.
today = datetime(2023, 3, 15)
# I was born 18 years before,
born = today - relativedelta(years=18)
# The answer formatted is
born.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
```

Executing the Generated Code

Finally, we can execute the generated Python code to find out the answer:

```python
exec(llm_out)
print(born)  # This will print the birth date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
```

### Conclusion

This approach shows how PAL uses programming to solve problems, allowing for a more precise and structured method of answering complex questions involving dates.
