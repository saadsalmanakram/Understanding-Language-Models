# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced approach that enhances language models by incorporating external knowledge sources for improved factual accuracy and reduced hallucination. Traditional language models rely solely on their parametric memory, making them susceptible to outdated or incorrect information. RAG addresses this by retrieving relevant documents dynamically, integrating them into the generation process.

## Why RAG?
General-purpose language models excel at tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, which do not require external knowledge. However, more complex and knowledge-intensive tasks demand real-time access to accurate information. RAG:

- Improves factual consistency.
- Reduces hallucinations in generated responses.
- Allows real-time updates without retraining the model.
- Enhances performance on benchmarks like Natural Questions, WebQuestions, and FEVER fact verification.

## How RAG Works
RAG consists of two main components:

1. **Retriever**: Fetches relevant documents from an external knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia, custom databases).
2. **Generator**: Uses a sequence-to-sequence model (like a fine-tuned Transformer) to generate responses based on retrieved documents.

### Workflow
1. The input query is provided.
2. The retriever fetches top-N relevant documents.
3. Retrieved documents are concatenated with the input query.
4. The generator processes the combined text and generates the final response.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- FAISS for fast vector search

### Installation
```bash
pip install torch transformers faiss-cpu datasets sentence-transformers
```

---

## Implementation
### 1. Data Preparation
First, let's set up a simple document store using FAISS and embed our knowledge base.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Load embedding model
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "Machine learning improves predictive models.",
    "Neural networks are inspired by the human brain.",
    "Transformers excel in natural language processing tasks.",
]

# Compute embeddings
document_embeddings = embedding_model.encode(documents, convert_to_numpy=True)

# Create FAISS index
d = document_embeddings.shape[1]  # Dimension of embeddings
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)
index.add(document_embeddings)
```

### 2. Query Processing with Retrieval
We retrieve the most relevant document for a given query.

```python
query = "How do transformers work?"
query_embedding = embedding_model.encode([query], convert_to_numpy=True)

# Search in FAISS index
D, I = index.search(query_embedding, k=1)
retrieved_doc = documents[I[0][0]]
print("Retrieved Document:", retrieved_doc)
```

### 3. Response Generation
Now, we use a Hugging Face model to generate a response incorporating retrieved information.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load pre-trained model
generator_model = "facebook/bart-large"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(generator_model)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(generator_model)

# Concatenate retrieved document with query
input_text = f"Query: {query} Context: {retrieved_doc}"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Generate response
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)
response = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Generated Response:", response)
```

## Use Cases
RAG is widely used in various real-world applications:
- **Question Answering**: Enhancing chatbots with real-time factual retrieval.
- **Scientific Research**: Generating accurate summaries based on recent publications.
- **Legal & Compliance**: Providing up-to-date regulations and policies.
- **Healthcare**: Offering reliable information on medical conditions and treatments.

---

## Conclusion
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) bridges the gap between static knowledge in language models and dynamic, evolving information needs. By integrating retrieval mechanisms, RAG significantly enhances the factual reliability of AI-generated content.
