Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting input prompts to optimize the output of language models. It involves selecting and structuring the right words, phrases, and instructions to guide the model in generating desired responses. The goal is to enhance the model's accuracy, relevance, and usefulness in various applications, such as question-answering, content generation, and dialogue systems. Prompt engineering can also include refining and iterating prompts based on the model's performance to achieve better results.
